The flaw enables attackers to bypass authentication, potentially gaining admin access to sites if the plugin’s two-factor authentication is enabled.What is Really Simple SecurityThe Really Simple Security plugin formerly known as “Really Simple SSL,” is a popular WordPress plugin used to enhance website security. Its primary features include enabling SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) on WordPress sites to ensure secure connections, providing additional security options such as two-factor authentication and implementing measures to harden a site’s defenses against attacks.I tried to replicate the CVE in my local and here is the detailed information about the issues faced while setting up the environment.Initial set up was done in my ubuntu local to replicate the CVE using the docker configuration file. Fresh wordpress and sql database was installed. Once i tried to download the vulnerabe plugin and install it from GUI i faced the multiple issues like Plugin directory didnt have enough permission Size restriction for the uploading plugin size Outgoing email restrictionFrom the following image we can see that the plugin upload was failed due to the permission issue, which can be fixed by providing the necessary permission to the hosting folder.Still after that i couldnt able to upload the plugin due to the size restriction for the uploading the plugin. It can be modified using the custom php.ini fileTo fully utilize the features of really simple ssl plugin and replicate the vulnerability we need to have an active outgoing email feature enabled in the server. To resolve this and for future usage i migrated the setup from my local to the digital ocean instance.To use the email feature we can use the WP-SMTP plugin service. And to configure the gmail we should need to get the oAuth secrest and ids from the google workspace. Once all these were configured we are ready to recreate the CVE vulnerabilityAfter setting up the environment in the digitalocean i faced the following error of 404 due to the pragmalinks were not enabled properly in the wordpress installation.

Dynamic Analysis (Behavioral Analysis) Attaching GDB to a live process allows you to perform dynamic analysis, which involves running the malware and observing its behavior in real-time. Memory Forensics By attaching GDB, you can analyze the memory layout of a running malware process(encrypted strings, how the malware allocates and uses memory, presence of malicious shellcode) Monitoring Process Injection Malware often injects malicious code into other processes (process injection) to hide its presence or escalate privileges.By attaching GDB we can monitor how the injection were performed, which system calls are used, how the injected code behaves in the target process. Program with Multiple ThreadsGDB has capability to deal with multiple threads of a process.It can be very useful when you’re debugging multi-threaded applications or malware that uses threads for concurrency. In a multi-threaded environment, GDB allows you to inspect, control, and manipulate individual threads within a running process. Thread Identification and Listing GDB can identify and display all the threads running within a process. Each thread has a unique identifier (ID) that can be used to switch between and control threads. Inspecting Thread-Specific Information Once you’ve switched to a thread, you can inspect its call stack and local variables. Each thread has its own stack, so the backtrace and variables can be different for each thread. Inspecting Deadlocks and Race Conditions If the application or malware involves deadlocks or race conditions, GDB can help investigate by examining the call stacks of all threads. You can switch between threads and inspect their state to determine which threads are waiting for locks or resources and identify potential synchronization problems. gcc sample.c -g -pthread -o sampleAbove command line compile a C program with specific options that enable debugging and multi-threading support.-pthread tells GCC to include support for POSIX threads (often referred to as pthreads), which is a threading library used in many Unix-like systems, including Linux.Run the program in the background to keep interacting with the command prompt.

Common Methods of Privilege Escalation in Linux Sudo Misconfigurations SUID/SGID Executables Weak File Permissions Exploiting Crontab Jobs PATH Environment Variable Manipulation NFS Misconfigurations Password Reuse or Weak Credentials Exploit of Service MisconfigurationsDEMO TIMEExploiting Setuid ProgramsLets start with a small program which easily allows us to perform the privilege escalaton. Vulnerable setuid programs on Linux systems could lead to privilege escalation attacks. In this exercise, we are using a regular user account and need to escalate the privileges to become root.-rwsr-xr-xFirst Character (-): This indicates the file type. - means it is a regular file.d means it is a directory.l means it is a symbolic link.Next Three Characters (rws): These are the owner (user) permissions. r = read permission for the owner.w = write permission for the owner.s = setuid (set user ID) bit, which means that when this file is executed, it runs with the permissions of the file’s owner (not the person who runs it). This is why it’s s instead of x (execute), as it also sets the user ID.Next Three Characters (r-x): These are the group permissions. r = read permission for the group.- = no write permission for the group.x = execute permission for the group.Last Three Characters (r-x): These are the other (world) permissions. r = read permission for others.- = no write permission for others.x = execute permission for others.From the above concept lets check the following binary welcome is having the suid set or not.Observe that the welcome binary has suid bit set (or on). This means that this binary and its child processes will run with root privileges. Also from the strings analysis we can see that the welcome binary is calling the greeting binary.Delete greetings binary and then copy /bin/bash to its location and rename that to greetings.By using this method we escalated the user account to root in the linux machine." }, { "title": "WIFI Security 3 - Honeypot", "url": "/posts/WIFI-Security-3-Honeypot/", "categories": "VAPT, WIFI", "tags": "vapt", "date": "2024-09-12 13:34:00 +0530", "snippet": "WEP honeypotIts type of decoy wireless network designed to attract and detect malicious activities, typically targeting attackers who exploit weak security protocols.Since the WEP is an vulnerable encryption, attackers will try to connect to it easily.

Task Manager doesn’t show a Parent-Child process view.In some situations we cant use the Process hacker and Process explorer, which were well built to identify this parent process.

Other than the Linux kernel itself, there is nothing special about containers.Use Play-With-DockerPlay-With-Docker, which is a website where we can run terminals directly from browser that have Docker installed.Why Containers Portable Lightweight and fast Better Resource Utilisation Easy for developer operations interfaceEach container has its own set of “namespaces” (isolated view) PID - Process ID USER - User and Group ID UTS - hostname and domainname NS - Mount point NET - Network devices, stacks, port IPC - Interprocess communication, message queue cgroup - controls limit and monitoring of resources.We use Docker, which has been the understood standard tool for using containers to build applications. Docker provides developers and operators with a friendly interface to build, ship, and run containers on any environment.1: Run our first container and learn how to inspect it. Explore the Docker Hub and discover common images ready to be run.Run a containerUse the Docker CLI to run first container.Open a terminal and run this command:&amp;amp; docker container run -t ubuntu topWe use the docker container run command to run a container with the Ubuntu image by using the top command. The -t flag allocates a pseudo-TTY, which you need for the top command to work correctly.The docker run command first starts a docker pull to download the Ubuntu image onto your host. After it is downloaded, it will start the container. The output for the running container should look like this:top is a Linux utility that prints the processes on a system and orders them by resource consumption. Notice that there is only a single process in this output: it is the top process itself. You don’t see other processes from the host in this list because of the PID namespace isolation.Containers use Linux namespaces to provide isolation of system resources from other containers or the host. The PID namespace provides isolation for process IDs. If you run top while inside the container, you will notice that it shows the processes within the PID namespace of the container, which is much different than what you can see if you ran top on the host.Even though we are using the Ubuntu image, it is important to note that the container does not have its own kernel. It uses the kernel of the host and the Ubuntu image is used only to provide the file system and tools available on an Ubuntu system.Inspect the container:docker container execThis command allows you to enter a running container’s namespaces with a new process.Open a new terminal. To open a new terminal connected to node1 by using Play-With-Docker.com, click Add New Instance on the left and then ssh from node2 into node1 by using the IP that is listed by node1, for example:In the new terminal, get the ID of the running container that you just created:docker container ls Use that container ID to run bash inside that container by using the docker container exec command. Because you are using bash and want to interact with this container from your terminal, use the -it flag to run using interactive mode while allocating a psuedo-terminal:$ docker container exec -it 3592d1aff390 bash You just used the docker container exec command to enter the container’s namespaces with the bash process. Using docker container exec with bash is a common way to inspect a Docker container.Notice the change in the prefix of your terminal, for example, root@b3ad2a23fab3:/. This is an indication that you are running bash inside the container.Tip: This is not the same as using ssh to a separate host or a VM. You don’t need an ssh server to connect with a bash process. Remember that containers use kernel-level features to achieve isolation and that containers run on top of the kernel. Your container is just a group of processes running in isolation on the same host, and you can use the command docker container exec to enter that isolation with the bash process. After you run the command docker container exec, the group of processes running in isolation (in other words, the container) includes top and bash.From the same terminal, inspect the running processes:$ ps -ef" }, { "title": "SQLi", "url": "/posts/SQLi/", "categories": "VAPT, SQLi", "tags": "vapt", "date": "2020-02-04 16:50:00 +0530", "snippet": "Yay its a post about SQLi.As per the OWASP Top 10 2017 it is a positioned as 1 and Rank 6 according to SANS TOP 25 of 2019.SQLi attack makes it possible to execute malicious SQL statements. These statements control a database server behind a web application.An SQL Injection vulnerability may affect any website or web application that uses an SQL database such as MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, or others.It is very common with PHP and ASP applications due to the prevalence of older functional interfaces. Due to the nature of programmatic interfaces available, J2EE and ASP.NET applications are less likely to have easily exploited SQL injections.Types of SQL InjectionsSQL injections typically fall under three categories: In-band SQLi (Classic), Inferential SQLi (Blind) and Out-of-band SQLi.In-band SQLiThe attacker uses the same channel of communication to launch their attacks and to gather their results. Error-based SQLi - Attacker analyse the error on web application and then perform attack Union-based SQLi - Utilise the Union operator and find the columns present in the database.Inferential (Blind) SQLiThe attacker sends data payloads to the server and observes the response and behavior of the server to learn more about its structure. Blind SQL injections rely on the response and behavioral patterns of the server so they are typically slower to execute but may be just as harmful. Blind SQL injections can be classified as follows: Boolean - Sends the SQL query and the result will vary depend on result(true or false) Time based - When the attackers payload is successful then application will take some time to respond.Out of band SQLiWhen same channel cant be used to SQLi then outofband used. Only possible when certain contains are met on the DB.Mitigation Input validation Parametrized queries including prepared statements.DEMOInjection Point for SQL Injection SQL Injection can be GET Based - Attack through URL parameter ( http://x.com/page.php?id=12 ) SQL Injection can be POST Based - Attack through Html Form ( signup, login ) SQL Injection can be Header Based - Attack through Header (Referrer,User-Agent, Location) SQL Injection can be Cookie Based - Attack through Cookie parameter ( Cookie : some=x; ) " }, { "title": "System Malware-3", "url": "/posts/System-Malware-3/", "categories": "SOC, Malware", "tags": "malware", "date": "2020-02-04 11:03:00 +0530", "snippet": "It is important for us to be able to understand C and C++ program binaries. As a beginner we will be restricting ourselves to just inspectC binaries. This can be extended to C++ binaries as well.This program over here defines a string called str which is initialised to “hello world”, and then invokes the printf function to printthat particular string.#include&amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;int main(){ char str[]=&quot;Hello readers&quot;; printf(&quot;%s&quot;,str);}Now, in order to execute this particular program. The first thing we do is enter this program in a text editor and save it as hello.c. Then use the compiler like this$&amp;gt; gcc hello.c which would create an a.out executable.This executable is stored in the disk. So, this executable has a format known as the ELF format or Executable Linker Format.When you want to execute this program, you run the command $&amp;gt; ./a.out from your shell. When this happens, the operating system gets invoked it loads the executable files from thehard disk and creates a process out of it which is present on the RAM.The process is then made to execute, and you would get the string “hello world” printed on your terminal.Executable Linker FormatELF format describes a structure by which object files and executables need to be stored.So, there are two views for the ELF format, one is the linker view and the other one is the executable viewThe linker view is applicable for object files, while executables have the executable view.So, an object file (hello.o) for hello.c can be created by this particular command. Now, hello.o is an ELF object file$&amp;gt; gcc hello.c -cWhen an object file is get opened it will shows something like thisAt the start you have an ELF header which describes the entire file organisation.Then you have various sections which contain the code, the data, the symbol table, relocation information and so on and you also have a section header table.So, in the section header table, essentially there is a structure which would help you locate the various sections present in the ELF object file. There is also a structure known as a program header table, but this is typically not present in the object file.ELF HeaderELF header defines a structure with various parameters.Identifier is a magic number which can be used to determine whether the file is an ELF fileso for example all ELF objects, ELF executables, libraries and so on would start off with this identifier.Entry describes the type - whether the file is an object, or an executable a shared object or a core fileMachine details which processor was this file compiled for.Entry which describes the virtual address, where program begins execution. So, this is more applicable for executables rather than object files or libraries.When the above mentioned C program is converted to executable file it will look like this. Use the command to view the ELF header of our program.$&amp;gt; readelf -H hello.oNote that it has the magic number which essentially is the ELF identification. Then you can see machine details, which tells object file was compiled for AMD, X86-64, that is, this objectfile can be only used by AMD and Intel machines which are configured for 64-bit.Then you have the entry point address, start of the section headers which is an offset of 368 bytes into the file. Also, the number of sectionheaders that are present is in this case is 13.Section HeadersThe section header table for this particular program can be obtained by running readelf with the -S option$&amp;gt; readelf -S hello.oFor better visualisation you can view the below mentioned imageThe offset specifies, the offset within that Elf object where you could find this specific section.For example, the .text section is present at an offset of 34 and has a size of 3C.So 3C here is the hexadecimal notation.There are other columns like Flag For example, A implies Allocated while X stands for Executable, which means that the section contains executable code and can be executed.In a similar way, for example, you have the .data section, has the flag WA, so W stands for Write. So, note that the data segment is writable but cannot be executed.Virtual Address - This is an object file, therefore each of these sections are relocatable. Therefore, the addresses present over here are all zero" }, { "title": "Nmap", "url": "/posts/Nmap/", "categories": "VAPT, Nmap", "tags": "vapt", "date": "2020-01-11 02:13:00 +0530", "snippet": "NmapHi,In the world of hacking and malware analysis it is useful to know about the tools which make your work less and find the information about target in less amount of time.One of such tool is Nmap - Network Mapper.It is used to analyse the open ports, guessing the OS, accurate packet routesThere are wide range of scan types present in Nmap: S.No Scan Type Description 1. SYN Scan sS Default Scan, Quiter than TCP connect, Send a SYN Packet and monitor the SYN ACK packet, Half-open connection on target 2. TCP connect sT Completes the TCP handshake and makes full connection, Noisy, More load 3. Ping Sweep sP Pinging all ports and find the open port. ICMP used to find the port. Faster for full port scan. Not accurate 4. UDP Scan sU Used to check UDP listening ports. Used to find trojan horses and hidden RPC services 5. FIN Scan sF Stealthy scan like SYN. False positive and negative becuase most sytemt dont send RST packet 6. NULL Scan sN Stealthy scan that sets all TCP header flags to off or null. Not a valid packet hence unreliable results 7. XMAS Scan sX Similiar to null scan but TCP header flags are on 8. Bounce Scan b Uses a vulnerability in FTP protocol and scan the internal network. If FTP server that is attached to the local LAN then you can use this. 9. RPC Scan Find RPC services. It is good to use this scan to find RPC services. Remote commands can be run in RPC. 10.

I hope you may have fun. I think system malware is a vast chapter which may take more patience in order to find fun in that. I hope that there will be more posting regarding the system malware.Happy hunting :-)In malware analysis we mostly find the infected binary and try to analyse the source and determine what it exactly to the environment and how much damage occur because of that.After this preliminary step we create a signature to stop its attack in the future.There are two signature methods. Host-based signature - Identify the files changed on that particular time of infection. Netwrok signature - Network traffic will be monitored for finding malware.These are the techinques used in the Malware Analysis Phase. Basic Static Analysis - Examining exe without running it. This method is mostly ineffective. Basic Dynamic Analysis - Running the malware in secure environment and get some signature from that. It doesnt need deep programming knowledge. Hence some functionlity malware will be missed. Advanced Static Analysis - Reverse engineering the malware internals by loading the exe in disassembler and anlyse the instruction what is does. It should need knowledge of disassembly, windows OS concepts. Advanced Dynamic Analysis - Using Debugger to analyse the internal of malicious exe.There are some common terminology given to malware in the real world environment. It might helpful in narrow down our finding if we know what malware will do in the real worl environment. Backdoor - Helps attacker to access the victim machine Botnet - These machines are zombies. Which are used to perform DDOS attack. Downloader - It will download other malicous code. Rootkit - It makes the other malware undetectale. When it is combined with backdoor it is difficult the backdoor in the system. Worm or virus - Code that copy itself and infect additional computers.BASIC STATIC ANALYSISIn static we ananlyse the malware without actually executing it in the real world environment by using previous hashes, antivirus tools, analysing files strings, functions and headers.VirustotalVirustotal is one of the best online tool to identify whether a file is malware or not based on set of malware database.Below mentioned is the Lab exercise of the first chapter (LAB01-01)Hash ValueAlso we can use the Hash value to find the malware. Hash value will be used to identify the files uniquley.You can see the sha value of the file is always same. Hence it can be used across malware researcher to share the malware files.String FinderA string is a sequence of characters. When a executable try to connect to a external environment or copies a message it will contains a string in it.finding that specific string will helpful in analysing the malicious program.If we’re searchin for specific string in a exe it is possible to find that string using the command grepPacked and Obfuscated MalwareObfuscated programs contains unknown or gibberish code which makes the malware analyst confuse. It is sometimes possible that legitimate code also obfuscated to protect the source code from the users.Packed programs are compressed programs. It limits your analysis on the suspicious executable. Packed and obfuscated codes will often use `LoadLibrary` and &#39;GetProcAddress` to load and gain access to additional functions" }, { "title": "Cross Site Scripting", "url": "/posts/Cross-Site-Scripting/", "categories": "VAPT, XSS_1", "tags": "vapt", "date": "2020-01-08 03:12:00 +0530", "snippet": "XSSXSS is most common because of user input is validated or encoded.Using XSS it is possible to access cookie, session tokens, and other sensitive information of victim.Vector - Javascript, HTML, Flash and other type of code that the browser may execute.Stored XSS - Payload is permanently stored on the target server(DB,logs,comment field).

In sandbox environment we can contron the malware activity by restricting it to only in that specific environment itself.Third approach is to Detect and Mitigate attacks like a antivirus software do." }, { "title": "Github CommandLineInterface", "url": "/posts/GithubCLI/", "categories": "General, Linux", "tags": "linux", "date": "2019-02-27 01:43:12 +0530", "snippet": "Post after long timeDuring the time when i publish this blog on github.I doesnt feel any challenge, its just like a cake walk(I forked a repository and make changes online whenever i feel that i want to make a post)When i tried to install git on my local machine then i came through across some challengses and lot of questions.

Make your hand dirty by working on CLI.When you are a beginner then its ok but when it comes to developers(if you’re planned to) then you must be familiar with CLI CLI will helps in automate your work CLI is only option for certain task(SSH tunnel into remote server) You know about what you going through. If you need some help from community, most of the solutions are available for CLI users(because there are plenty of GUI out there) It really feels good(Trust me :-)Connecting to Github from CLI?If you don’t want to reenter your passphrase every time you use your SSH key, you can add your key to the SSH agent, which manages your SSH keys and remembers your passphrase. Please make sure you are already having a ssh key, if you already have one use that one itself. Else you can generate a new one and use that. Use the following command to generate ssh key $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &quot;your_email@example.com&quot; It will prompt you to enter a passphrase.Then you need to add this ssh key to your ssh agent. To do that Start the ssh agent in the background $ eval &quot;$(ssh-agent -s)&quot; Add your ssh key to the ssh agent.

Some of you may try to resolve this by surfing through some random sites and try to put the command which are mentioned in that site.I am taking to myself only.This is exactly what i do in most cases.So in this post i will try to teach myself what exactly this means by breaking down each and everthing.Lets break things down.This is the error which i mentioned previouslyE: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/)Why in the world it should get locked?This is simply means when you try to install a new package, there is some package trying to updrade or running in the background which might be launched by other users of the os.The way how package management tool on Ubuntu/Debian or any other Linux operating system works is that every time package installation or update is initiated, the package management tool, in this case apt or dpkg, creates a lock file /var/lib/apt/lists/lock or var/lib/dpkg/lock to prevent concurrent execution of another software installation or update process.What causes it to lock?There is chance that ubuntu tries to update automatically in the background.Solution is wait for it to complete.You can also turn off the auto update of package in the background by the following method:$ sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgradesOnce you have the file opened, switch off the Update-Package-Lists directive from 1 to 0Finding the process and user who holding the lock?1.Note the error message thrown in the terminal2.$sudo fuser Path of lock(see the error message )3.Using tha PID (which is found in step 2) find the user who causes the lock.$ ps -p “PID” -o user,comm,argsUnlocking the /var/lib/apt/lists/lcok Warning: Do not forcefully remove the lock, if there is chance it can be done by itself. Let it do its work.Force remove sometime cause harm to your system.$ sudo kill -9 “PID”" }, { "title": "PPA VS Normal", "url": "/posts/PPA-installation-VS-Normal-installation/", "categories": "General, Linux", "tags": "linux", "date": "2019-01-27 04:38:00 +0530", "snippet": "How does the following installation are differ from one another?$sudo add-apt-repository ppa:maco.m/ruby $sudo apt-get update $sudo apt-get install rubygems Line1 : adds PPA to your list of sources Line2 :Tells apt-get to get update its databaseLine3 :finds the updated package from the database and installs it. $sudo apt-get install rubygems It will just install the less recent version of the specific package.What is PPA?PPA - Personal Package Archives These are generally used by the people who want latest and greatest. Also it involves some danger(You should definitely know what you are doing).Ubuntu distro usually released at every 6 months. Hence if you want some update before their release you can use PPA for that.You can add PPA to your machine using 2 Methods: 1.GUI - Ubunutu supports this feature (There are many articles out there please refer those) 2.Command line - Refer the question If you want to remove the PPA, then just removing the specific repository from the source.list file is not enough.It would be better to remove all the package which are installed along with that installation of PPA and then replace with the default package.$sudo ppa-purge ppa:&amp;lt;lp-name&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;ppa-name&amp;gt;" } ]
