DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.  

DevOps has emerged as the leading approach in software and product development, offering enhanced visibility, improved coordination, and faster iterations compared to traditional methodologies like SDLC or Agile. Its widespread adoption has made a solid understanding of DevOps processes essential for both Pentesters and DevOps professionals.  

**Version Control System**  

Developers write source code in their chosen programming language, often utilizing development frameworks within their preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or text editor. For smaller, independent projects, the code is typically compiled and packaged into a deployable form directly within the IDE. However, in larger projects with multiple contributors, code from all developers must be consolidated in a centralized Code Repository before moving on to the build phase.  

Demo Time  

Lets utilise the Git and Gitlab server to perform the following operations in this exercise  

1. Create a Code Repository
2. Clone existing Code repository
3. Make Code commits and pushing code
4. Maintaining different branches
5. Undoing Commits and rollbacks 

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) for managing the software source code. Git can be hosted on the cloud or on the local system. And we are utilising the Gitlab for server reporsitory hosting.
