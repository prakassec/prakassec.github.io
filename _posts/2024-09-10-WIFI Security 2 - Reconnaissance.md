**Reconnaissance**

Wi-Fi reconnaissance is the process of identifying and exploiting wireless networks. Using reconnaissance we can identify the unauthorized access points (rogue APs) or malicious devices on a network.  

Passive Reconnaissance  

By observing beacon frames and probe requests, an attacker can map out access points, clients, and SSIDs (network names). Tools like wireshark, kismet can be used for this purpose  

Active Reconnaissance  

Using probing we can reach the access point and gather informations like signal strength, device manufacturer etc  
Deauthentication Attacks - Forcing the device off to observe their behaviour
