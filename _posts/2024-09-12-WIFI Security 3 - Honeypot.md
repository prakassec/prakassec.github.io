WEP honeypot  

Its type of decoy wireless network designed to attract and detect malicious activities, typically targeting attackers who exploit weak security protocols.  
Since the WEP is an vulnerable encryption, attackers will try to connect to it easily. By which we can understand about their attack tactics.  

**DEMO**

Lets create a WEP honeypot using Hostapd and lure the client to connect to it.  

Hostapd  

Software application used to create and manage wireless access points on Linux-based systems.  
We can convert the computer to Access Point (AP) turning it to wireless router or hotspot.
