**Linux Privilege Escalation**  

During an engagement, if we got the access for the low privilege user in the linux environment then it might be necessay to escalate our privilege to other user it might the user having similar access or to a high privilege user to avoid the detection and steathiness.  

1. Vertical Privilege Escalation (Elevation)
   
   A user with lower privileges (e.g., a regular user) gains higher privileges, such as administrative or root access.
   This could allow the user to perform system-level actions, modify sensitive files, or access restricted data.

2. Horizontal Privilege Escalation
   
   A user accesses another userâ€™s privileges without involving their account in the system logs.
