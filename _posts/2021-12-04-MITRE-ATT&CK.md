**Hello World**  
MITRE    
As a security analyst/cyber security person we might know about MITRE as a framework, but the actual intent of MITRE is safety,stability and well-being of nation(includes cyber space, artificial intelligence)

Actually i'm also new to the defense field, so in one of the job posting i do see that their requirement involves multiple frameworks which used in blue team.  

```Understanding of industry standard threat frameworks (Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain, Diamond Model, MITRE ATT&CK)```

 ATT&CK® (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework  is the projects developed by MITRE
 
 MITRE began to address the need to record and document common TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups used against enterprise Windows networks.  

Earlier ATT&CK was focused only on windows, then it was expanded to linux and macos. It is also useful for red teamers/pentesters

From the above mentioned link we can find the navigation of ATT&CK metrices  

It can be modified and added to the teams need in the organisation  

To summarize, we can use the ATT&CK Matrix to map a threat group to their tactics and techniques.  There are various methods the search can be initiated. The questions below will help you become more familiar with the ATT&CK®. It is recommended to start answering the questions from the Phishing page.  

**It was also built on github pages like this blog**
